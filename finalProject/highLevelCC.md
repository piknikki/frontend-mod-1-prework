declare an empty string to put the letters into as they're encoded

loop through the string, checking for letters 
(considering all spaces and punctuation, and not changing them)
then for letters, add/subtract the number of spaces passed in as a parameter, and output the 
letter that corresponds to that unicode number.

need to use regex to search for letters

need to know the values of the letters (I think there's a unicode for each letter??)

need to consider capital letters vs lower case letters

I'd like to attempt this, but I don't think I can today. I'll try tomorrow.
