## Section 3 Reflection

1. *What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?* --> 
The first thing that stood out was that failure is how you learn strategies. Going through and learning from making a 
mistake informs how we will address the same or even similar problems in the future. This is how strategies are created, 
so that we can use those skills in other situations, and that's why experience is so important in learning how to code -- 
we can't gain that knowledge without going through the mistakes. The other thing that stood out for me was that Growth Mindset 
is not actually a complete picture of how I think we should approach learning. I think that, to fully embrace learning what 
is essentially a new language, we need to consider how Growth Mindset (GM) intersects with Emotional Intelligence (EI). GM 
teaches us to focus on what we can do to improve our speed and effectiveness of learning, whereas EI teaches us how that 
affects and is perceived by the world outside of ourselves. I think both are incredibly important in knowing how to go forward 
with learning and interacting with teams, so that we can all do our very best.

1. *In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?* --> I think I'm pretty good 
at GM, because I am fine with failure, mistakes, and asking for help. The area where I can struggle is with receiving feedback 
and being flexible in thinking when receiving that feedback. I can be stubborn about hearing ideas that I've already dismissed 
as inconsequential -- but sometimes I'm wrong!! And I need to be better about hearing that.

1. *Think of a web or mobile application you use regularly. Where is an example of a place that the developers probably use Arrays? Explain.* --> 
Arrays are used pretty much everywhere on the internet. I think it would be harder to find something that _doesn't_ use arrays. 
Examples are Etsy, Amazon, Dev, any blog you read, CNN, etc. etc. 

1. *In your own words, explain what an Array method is.* --> Array methods are functions that can be used with arrays. Examples 
are .sort, .length, .reverse, .pop, .push, etc.

1. *What is the purpose of a loop? When we would use a loop in conjunction with array vs. without?* --> Loops iterate through 
arrays or sometimes objects. Looping with an array would be a situation where we want to check each item in the array using 
conditionals. Looping without an array would possibly be where we want to run through a series of numbers (not starting with 
an array, but just using numbers as the iteration);

1. *If you had to teach a 5 year old about loops, how would you explain it?* --> We need to define a starting point, a stopping 
point, and tell it how many to do at a time. It's sort of like playing hopscotch: you jump the number of times your pebble lands on. 
But you can also go backwards, and you can jump more than one spot at a time.

1. *What questions do you still have about Arrays and loops?* --> I'm curious what scenarios would use loops without arrays. 
It doesn't seem super useful.
