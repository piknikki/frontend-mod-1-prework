## Section 1 Reflection

1. *How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?*
 => I enjoyed the article and feel that I do most of the things already. I thought that "unlearning" resonated with me because I feel 
like I need to unlearn what I know so far so I can truly learn this content with fresh eyes. I need to learn more deeply, and use 
the skills I'm learning repetitively and regularly. 
2. *What are the data types you learned about in this section? In your own words, define each.* => numbers are numbers (can be int or float), 
strings are anything inside single or double quotes, and boolean is true/false.

3. *How would you log the string `"Hello World!"` to the console?* => `console.log("Hello World!");`

4. *What is/are the character(s) you would use to indicate comments in a JavaScript file? What is the purpose of a code comment?* => comments are 
indicated with `//` in js. Comments are used to convey meaning or notes to other developers if it's not immeditately obvious. Some 
owners of repos use linters that don't allow a lot of comments, and some like to keep the code cleaner so that tests run faster. But 
generally, I'd say that comments are good until they're not. 

5. *In your own words, what is a variable? How would you explain it to a 5 year old?* => A variable is a placeholder or a pointer 
to the value that it represents. It's like a box that holds something; the something inside can change (variable reassignment), 
but the box stays the same.

6. *Think of a site or app you use frequently. What are three variables that are probably used? Which data type would each of those variables probably hold?* => 
I use Etsy a lot. Quantities (number (int)), amounts (float or possibly string, as they're international and I don't know how they handle other 
monetary denominations), descriptions (string), itemName (string), etc. are all used there. 

7. *In your own words, explain what concatenation is.* => Concatenation is when you add variables to other variables. This could be 
a number to a number, a number added to a string, a boolean added to a string, etc. Information is not required to be in a variable 
(you can add a string that is unassigned to a variable to another string that is assigned to a variable).

8. *Think of a site or app you use frequently. Where do you think the developers used concatention?* => On Etsy there is a 
welcome back message, so they probably used concatenation to add "Welcome back" and a name variable.

9. *What questions do you still have about the work we've done so far? (not having a question is not an option)* I'd like to work on 
how to learn this information from a fresh perspective so that I can truly apply it.
