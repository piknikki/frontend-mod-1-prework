## Section 4 Reflection

1. *How different did your workflow feel this week, considering we asked you to follow the Pomodoro technique?* --> I'm 
still working out a method of implementing the Pomodoros. But I also had lots of time on my hands and have been just taking 
my time with the class stuff.

1. *Regarding the work you did around setting intentions in Step 1 of the Pomodoro technique - how did that go? Were you 
surprised by anything (did you find yourself way more focused than you realized, more distracted that you thought you'd be, 
estimating times accurately or totally off, etc)?* --> I'll add more about this later, once I've done it a little bit.

1. *What is an Object, and how is it different from an Array in Javascript?* --> Objects are contained in curly braces (arrays 
are contained in square brackets), and they consist of key/value pairs (the key in arrays is the index position of each item) 
which can be strings, allowing us to almost treat an object like a database that holds lots of info.

1. *For each set of data, would an array or object be better to store it? Explain your choice.*

  * List of all of the students in class --> if it's only names, then maybe an array; but for more robust info, objects would 
  hold more information.
  * List of states and their capitals --> object because it's most likely that users of this list will need to access states 
  and capitals for different uses.
  * List of things to pack for vacation --> an array might be best, since you really only need to look at it; if you want to 
  check things off, then you could get into an object implementation.
  * Names of all the Instagram accounts I follow --> probably an array, since it's just their account names.
  * List of student names and their cohort -- object, so that you can hold different cohorts for different students.
  * Ingredients and amount of each ingredient to bake a cake --> object, because there will be more than one type of information.
  * All my favorite restaurants -- array if you only want their names; if you added reviews and/or likes or something, you 
  would use an object.

1. *In this section, we talked about a `transaction item object`. It has keys that represent different properties a bank 
transaction would have, and values that store the data. In a banking app, this data would eventually be displayed in the 
browser for the user. Think of another Object in a web application that you use frequently. What is it? What keys might 
be on it? What are example values?*  --> Any social media app would have an object for comments, like we did in the exercise. 
It would include likes, comments, etc. I guess I struggle with finding implementations of objects for data that wouldn't 
be in a database. Maybe a shopping site that would collect your shipping address as a guest shopper (not logged in)?

1. *What questions do you still have about classes and/or Objects?* --> I don't have questions, but I definitely need to 
practice more. I will build some more stuff tomorrow, to practice the classes, properties, and methods we learned in this 
section.


*Reflection about time estimation from README* --> So far, I have not been keeping track of time, primarily because I've been 
working on the sections whenever I can, for as long as I can. In my previous job, though, I needed to work on tickets in a 
timely fashion. I understand and am familiar with the Pomodoro technique, and feel like it should be used when necessary, 
as opposed to all the time. There are times when I'm in my flow and need to stay engaged, and would be super irritated by 
having to take a break. But there are also times when I recognize that I should have taken a break earlier. So I'll try to 
be more cognizant of my time now and try to determine some criteria for using Pomodoros. I do know that I work best in the 
early morning (like 4 or 5 am to about 8 or 9), and that is when I'm most productive. Afternoons are hard for me, because I'm 
exhausted by about 3 pm. I love taking naps, so I might try to see if I can work a nap into my daily routine so that I can 
work later (since the days of this course go until 5 pm, plus I have to then feed my kids and do whatever "homework" is 
required from classtime). I'll definitely need to figure out a new schedule.
