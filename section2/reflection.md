## Section 2 Reflection

1. *Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait 
too long, or somewhere in between?* --> I feel like I can 
spend a lot of time down rabbit holes, which gets me good research information, but may or may not find a solution. I think 
I need help with filtering results, to determine what is a reasonable path of research vs a non-viable path.

1. *In this section, we removed some of the supports that you had in Section 1. We didn't give the directions for how to 
run a file in node, and really sent you off to learn about functions by exploring several outside resources. How did that 
feel? What was uncomfortable about it? How did it support your learning?* --> It was fine. I'm used to doing a lot of 
independent research. 

1. *What is a conditional statement? Give one example of a daily life conditional. Give one example of where a conditional 
is probably used in a web application you use.* --> Conditional statements ask whether a condition is true or false. An 
example might be: `timeNow >= noon`. Most sites and applications that are used for shopping include authentication, where 
the code checks to see if you're logged in or not. So Etsy might have a conditional that checks if you're logged in and if not, 
it offers you the option to log in; if you are logged in, it greets you by your first name.

1. *How do you add multiple conditions to an `if` statement? In your own words, explain how to program reads them and 
determines what to do.* --> You could add conditions using `&&` or `||` (logical operators), or adding `else if` blocks. 
the program approaches it line by line, checking to see if the conditions in the first block are met; if not, it goes to the 
next block. That's why a default should be at the end (last `else` block), so that it knows what to do if none of the previous 
conditions are met (then again, the opposite is a good strategy, if there's only one condition you want to check).

1. *What tools are available to you, as a developer, if you want to check that TWO conditions are met? Or, if you want to 
check that 1 of 2 conditions are met, before running a block of code?* --> I would use logical operators (`&&` and `||`).

1. *What questions do you still have about `if` statements and/or functions?* --> I don't have questions, but did really 
appreciate the explicit description of the difference between arguments and parameters. I definitely have been muddling them 
up for a while. I also really appreciated the statement that functions are name/value pairs. It helps me understand how 
everything in JS is an object.
